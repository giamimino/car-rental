# Car Rental — Frontend Demo

A lightweight **Car Rental** demo web app built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
It uses a local `cars.json` data file to populate a list of available cars and a small `app.js` to power UI interactions.

> Deployment: [Car Rental](https://giamimino.github.io/car-rental/).

This repo is a small, front-end-first proof-of-concept for a car rental UI: show cars, view details, and simulate a booking flow using local JSON data. Great as a portfolio piece or a starting point to add a backend and real booking logic.
